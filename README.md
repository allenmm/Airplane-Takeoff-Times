This folder contains a project to schedule aircraft takeoff time slots at 
an airport called allen_take_off_time. The program will take in input from 
a file from the terminal, read the lines, and load a line of the file 
request into the constructor of the class. It will then combine this class 
with a priority queue to sort the information and pass it back into the 
constructor of the class again to have a sorted list of class objects. 
The ordered list of class objects will then be used to write the current 
status of the airplanes in the queue and actual takeoff times to the 
command line for the user. This project itself contains a README.md, 
two versions of the SDD, and four python modules.
