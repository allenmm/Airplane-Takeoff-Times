This folder contains a project to schedule aircraft take off time slots at an airport called allen_take_off_time.
The program will take in input from a file from the terminal, read the lines, and load a line of the file request into the constructor of the class. It will then combine this class with a priority queue to sort the information and write the current status of the airplanes in the queue and actual take off times to the command line for the user.
This project itself contains a README.md, two versions of the SDD, and will contain four python modules.
